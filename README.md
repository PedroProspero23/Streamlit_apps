# Streamlit_apps

This repository contains a collection of web applications built using Streamlit, a powerful Python framework that allows data projects to be transformed into interactive, shareable tools with minimal code. My objective with this space is to explore how data analysis, modeling, and automation can be packaged into user-friendly interfaces that improve decision-making, communication, and accessibility.

As a student of Business Administration at the European International University in Paris and an MBA candidate in Project Management at USP ESALQ (e-distance learning), I’m particularly focused on creating tools that bridge the gap between technical data workflows and real-world usability. The applications developed here aim to support business planning, financial analysis, agribusiness management, and simulation models — offering simple inputs, dynamic outputs, and clear visual feedback.

Each app is developed entirely in Python and often integrates additional tools such as Excel files, Power BI exports, or local datasets. I structure these projects to include clean code, documentation, and a focus on the user experience, always striving to simplify complexity without losing analytical depth.

This repository reflects my interest in turning data projects into accessible solutions, whether for professionals with no coding background or for teams that need fast, actionable insights. As I continue to build new apps, I aim to expand the scope and visual quality of the tools while maintaining clarity, consistency, and real business relevance.
